# monopoly_fun

For right now, this is a script that scrapes your history of entered codes from playmonopoly.us and saves them to a csv file.  I made this out of boredom in a night and might later expand functionality to include some analysis if time permits and I discover anything interesting.

## Instructions

1) Install Selenium Webdriver using the following command
  ```
  pip install selenium
  ```

2) Download Chromedriver (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and extract the chromedriver executable to the folder containing monopoly_scraper.py

3) Add your email and password to the config.ini file, then run monopoly_scraper.py
